-- Sample of adding an AD group and creating a role
/*
Create an Active Directory group on the domain called GroupName 
(which we were already using for file permissions to the folders).  Then created a database role 
called ExpertImage and added the group to this role.  Then grant update rights to 
CRT_CASH and APT_INVOICE to the role.
