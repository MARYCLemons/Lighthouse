Create a simple workflow

Create a new Visual Studio 2012 empty solution called CreationEndpointTest.

Add a new WCF Workflow Service Application project called SimpleWorkflow to the solution. The workflow designer will open.

Delete the ReceiveRequest and SendResponse activities. 
     These activities are what makes a workflow a workflow service. 
     Since we are not working with a workflow service, we no longer need them.

Set the DisplayName for the sequence activity to “Sequential Workflow”.

Rename Service1.xamlx to Workflow1.xamlx.

Click the designer outside of the sequence activity, and set the Name and ConfigurationName properties to “Workflow1”

Drag a WriteLine activity into the Sequence. 
      The WriteLine activity can be found in the Primitives section of the toolbox. 
      Set the Text property of the WriteLine activity to “Hello, world”.
